    <h2>Traffic Maintenance</h2>
    <p>The Traffic Maintenance Division is responsible for maintaining the City’s
      traffic signals, traffic signs, roadway markings, and streetlights.
      In 2014-15, DOT made 2,200 repairs to traffic signals. DOT responded to
      signal malfunctions within 30 minutes 55 percent of the time, down by 5
      percentage points since the year prior.
    </p>
    <p>DOT’s response to traffic and street name sign service requests fell within
      established priority guidelines 97 percent* of the time in 2014-15. 2,700
      signs were preventively maintained.
    </p>
    <p>Roadway marking services were completed within established priority
      guidelines 99 percent* of the time in 2014-15. 65 percent of roadway
      markings met visibility and operational guidelines. This is down from 80
      percent in 2007-08, when the City had identified the visibility of roadway
      markings as a priority and set aside one-time funding for markings.
    </p>
    <p>97 percent of San José’s 64,000 streetlights were operational.
      44 percent of malfunctions were repaired within seven days, compared to 87
      percent in 2009-10. LED streetlight conversions and new installations
      continue; in 2014-15, about 19,000 new LED lights were installed. More than
      4,400 streetlight outages were caused by stolen or cut wire in 2014-15.
      With temporary resources, DOT eliminated the repair backlog and is
      responding to most new cases within 2 to 4 weeks.
