    <h2>Streetscapes Maintenance</h2>
    <p>DOTâ€™s Landscape Services Division maintains median islands and undeveloped
      rights-of-way, and ensures the repair of sidewalks and the maintenance of
      street trees. In 2014-15, DOT maintenance staff provided basic
      safety-related and complaint-driven activities to keep an estimated 54
      percent of street landscapes in good condition, down from 68 percent 10
      years ago.
    </p>
    <p>There are an estimated 268,000 street trees in the City.* DOT responded
      to 474 emergencies for street tree maintenance in 2014-15. DOT indicated
      that emergency street tree repairs were largely a result of stormy weather and
      extremely hot or windy days and that 2014-15 was a mild year. The City
      initiated 7,300 sidewalk repairs in 2014-15, more than double the amount 10
      years ago because of added staffing.
    </p>
    <div class="info-text">
      * Property owners are typically responsible for maintaining street trees
      and repairing adjacent sidewalks. The City maintains trees that are located
      within the arterial medians and roadside landscaped areas owned by the City.
