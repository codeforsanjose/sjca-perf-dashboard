    <h2>Parking</h2>
    <p>Parking Services is responsible for managing on-street and off-street
      parking, implementing parking policies and regulations, and supporting
      street sweeping, construction, and maintenance activities. Monthly parking
      in 2014-15 reached approximately 95,000 monthly customers in City
      facilities, up 63 percent compared to 10 years ago. About 1.7 million
      downtown customers used City parking facilities in 2014-15, up 5 percent
      compared to the prior year.
    </p>
    <p>The Department issued about 204,000 parking citations in 2014-15, 5
      percent below the prior year because of staff vacancies. 90 percent of
      abandoned vehicles were moved by the owner or otherwise in compliance by
      DOTâ€™s second visit.
